Why?
The primary reason for creating a self-playing Flappy Bird game using NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of artificial intelligence in game environments. This project aims to:

1. Learn AI Concepts: Provide hands-on experience with evolutionary algorithms and neural networks, specifically the NEAT algorithm, which evolves neural networks to solve complex tasks.
2. Automate Game Playing: Develop a system that can autonomously learn and improve its performance in playing Flappy Bird without human intervention, showcasing the potential of AI in automating repetitive tasks.
3. Educational Value: Serve as a learning resource for others interested in AI and game development, illustrating how AI can be applied to real-world scenarios.
4. Innovation and Fun: Combine the fun and challenge of a popular game with cutting-edge AI technology, resulting in an innovative and entertaining project.

What?

This project involves developing an AI agent  that can play the Flappy Bird game by itself. The core components include:

1. Flappy Bird Game: A clone of the popular Flappy Bird game, implemented in Python using Pygame.
2. NEAT Algorithm: An implementation of the NEAT algorithm to evolve neural networks that can control the bird in the game.
3. AI Agent: The AI agent, controlled by a neural network, learns to navigate the bird through the pipes by making real-time decisions based on the game state.
4. Training Process: The NEAT algorithm evolves the neural networks over generations, selecting the most successful ones and applying genetic operations (mutation and crossover) to create better-performing networks.

I wanted to inform you that I might be transitioning to a different project soon. However, at this stage, I am currently focused on creating graphics for this 2D game made in Python.
